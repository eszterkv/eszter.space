In small steps, with budget recommendations.

## The basics

### 1. Sit (or stand) at a desk

No lying on the couch, melting into a deep sofa, or on your belly on the carpet. These are all very bad for posture, and might lead to problems with your joints.

$: kitchen table  
$$: common desk from IKEA & co.  
$$$: sit/stand desk

### 2. Look straight ahead

Screen height should be at eye level, so it's less strain on your eyes, and you can keep a straight neck + back.

**Elevating a laptop will require an external keyboard and mouse. We'll get to that.**

$: large books or thin boxes you already have at home - just put your laptop on top
$$: laptop stand
$$$: monitor(s)

### 3. Learn touch typing

Great, you're working with a straight back and looking ahead at eye level. Now it's time to keep your eyes on the screen (but don't forget to look away occasionally :))

## Level up: do you have a specific issue?

For me, it's the wrists. I can sit in any weird position or the most uncomfortable chair all day and my back will be fine, but one day without a proper keyboard and trackball, and my wrists start aching. For others, they can pound away on Macbook Pros all day, but give them the wrong chair and they'll have back pain within a few hours.

### Wrists

split ergo mech keyboard. the split/ergo part is somewhat optional, but definitely get a mechanical one.

$: no truly budget option I'm afraid - try to get your employer to buy you one
$$: some simple keeb (could be gaming, Filco, Anne Pro etc.) with proper switches
$$$: custom split ergo boards (link to reddit etc)

### Lower back

Invest in a chair! The various budget options will go from least to most effective, so if you already have problems, you really should put some money here.

$: second-hand gaming chair. I once found one for Â£7 at a charity shop[^and held on to it like my life depended on it, until my bf arrived with the cash I didn't have on me!]
$$: basic office chair from Office Depot, IKEA & co.
$$$: -> reddit thread, examples, everything adjustable
