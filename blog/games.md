The closest I ever got to gaming was [Abe’s Oddysee](http://www.oddworld.com/oddworldgames/abes-oddysee/) (I guess Robot Unicorn Attack doesn’t count.) — but I do enjoy the odd game now and then.

Here’s an absolutely subjective selection for killing (not too much) time.

### Lunar lander

**What:** a simple but challenging game where you have to land a rover on the moon.\
**How to play:** online on [moonlander.seb.ly](http://moonlander.seb.ly/)\
**Why:** because it’s so pretty and monochrome.

### killersheep

**What:** sheep invaders. It’s a vim plugin demonstrating new vim features (as in, [popups in 8.2](https://www.vim.org/vim-8.2-released.php)).\
**How to play:** by upgrading vim and installing the [vim plugin](https://github.com/vim/killersheep).\
**Why:** because you can shoot at neon sheep flying across your vim screen and pooping at you.

### ninvaders

**What:** space invaders in your console.\
**How to play:** `brew install ninvaders` or `sudo apt-get install ninvaders`.\
**Why:** you shouldn’t have to exit the console to play space invaders.

### Google console text adventure game

**What:** a text adventure game. I didn’t find it too interesting, but it’s an honorable mention.\
**How to play:** Google 'Text adventure' (really *Google*, don’t DuckDuckGo) and open the console.\  
**Why:** there’s lots of creative stuff people do in the console. This is one of them.

### Bonus: Chess

**What:** good old chess, human versus machine.\
**How to play:** if you have a mac, you have chess.\
**Why:** being beaten by the computer [feels a bit like being part of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1).
