    title: 'Never Let Me Go',
    author: 'Kazuo Ishiguro',
    year: 2005,
    quote: 'It was like when you make a move in chess and just as you take your finger off the piece, you see the mistake you’ve made, and there’s this panic because you don’t know yet the scale of disaster you’ve left yourself open to.',

  {
    title: 'Weapons of Math Destruction',
    author: 'Cathy O’Neil',
    quote: 'Our own values and desires influence our choices, from the data we choose to collect to the questions we ask. Models are opinions embedded in mathematics.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Drinking — A Love Story',
    author: 'Caroline Knapp',
    quote: 'For a long time, when it's working, the drink feels like a path to a kind of self-enlightenment, something that turns us into the person we wish to be, or the person we think we are. In some ways the dynamic is simple: alcohol makes everything better, until it makes everything worse.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Infidel',
    author: 'Ayaan Hirsi Ali',
    quote: 'The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance is atheism. It is not a creed. Death is certain, replacing both the siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell. Life on this earth, with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure, feel loneliness and joy and love. There is nothing more; but I want nothing more.',
  },
  {
    title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
    author: 'Harper Lee',
    quote: 'I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.',

  {
    title: 'The Tender Bar',
    author: 'J.R. Moehringer',
    quote: 'I hate when people ask what a book is about. People who read for plot, people who suck out the story like the cream filling in an Oreo, should stick to comic strips and soap operas. What’s it about? Every book worth a damn is about emotions and love and death and pain. It’s about words. It’s about a man dealing with life.',
